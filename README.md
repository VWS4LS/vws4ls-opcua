# vws4ls-opcua

The new companion specification ["OPC 40570: OPC UA for Wire Harness Manufacturing](https://profiles.opcfoundation.org/document/214) for standardized interaction of the process control (MES) with the production resources (machines) in wire harness manufacturing, is developed within the project [VWS4LS](https://arena2036.de/en/asset-administration-shell-for-wire-harness) in cooperation with the [VDMA assocation](https://vdma.org/viewer/-/v2article/render/1248676).

<u>Artifacts from VWS4LS related to OPC UA are placed in this repository:</u>

[xmi2vec-opcua.xsl](https://github.com/VWS4LS/vws4ls-opcua/blob/main/xmi2vec-opcua.xsl): A transformation with a corresponding XSLT script was developed to convert the VEC model available as XMI into an OPC UA nodeset in accordance with defined rules. At the same time, the model is filtered down to the classes that are relevant for the scope of the interface.
